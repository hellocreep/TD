                            Taking a train to Tibet provides you the best chance to witness and enjoy the changes from the wide plains to the snow-capped mountains on the world highest Tibetan Plateau. It is also better for you to get used to the high altitude gradually during the train journey. It is absolutely a great experience to take the world's highest railway.
