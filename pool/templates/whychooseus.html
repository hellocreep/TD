		<h1>Why Tour Tibet with us?</h1>

				<p>
					For many experienced travellers, Tibet is the ultimate destination -
					an exotic land on the roof
					of the world - for us it is our home. Each year we migrate to Tibet as the
					nomads migrate to the higher summer pastures.
					I guess we are now nomads too. We know and
					understand Tibet better than any other travel company.
					</br></br>
					Tibet is the trip of a lifetime. We believe that your trip
					should be truly unforgettable, so
					we never take any chances. Take the hassle out
					of planning your next Tibet trip, and leave it
					to Tibetdiscovery. We've spent 20 years
					discovering the every corner
					of Tibet for the best things to see and do in the Holy Land,
					and we can't wait to share it all with you.
