			<h1>Responsible Tibet Travel</h1>
			<span> Tibet is the destination that needs your help. </span>
			<p>
				Travelling with Tibetdiscovery means looking after the Holy Land, and empowering local communities in Tibet.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every place around Tibet is special - and we want our hometown stay that way. Our Responsible Travel ethos is at the heart of everything we do, from respecting Tibetan cultures and the environment, to initiating projects that make positive contributions to local communities.

			<h2 class="underline">What You Can Do</h2>
			<h3>Buy Locally</h3>
			<p>
				The first is to be responsible in the travel agency that you choose. Tibetdiscovery.com is actually based on the Tibetan Plateau and is managed and staffed by our Tibetan people. By choosing a local Tibetan agency to use, more of your tourism money will be put back into the economy of our Tibetan people.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second is to try and use as many Tibetan owned hotels, shops and restaurants as possible. This will also help to better the economy of our Tibetan people.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please Keep in Mind: Never ever buy products made from endangered wildlife or endangered plants.
			</p>
			<h3>Respect the Local Culture & Religion </h3>
			<p>
				Be open-minded and aware that your cultural values may differ from locals. This may include different concepts of time, personal space and communication etc.
			</p>
			<p>
				Make the effort to learn about local cultural sensitivities: For example – wear full length trousers or skirts and modest tops that are not revealing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Avoid wearing shorts or short skirts and tops which bare shoulders. – Point with an open palm and not your index finger. – Avoid patting or touching children on the head.
			</p>
			<h3>Minimize your Waste & Dispose of Waste Appropriately </h3>
			<p>
				Carry reusable cups, plates, cutlery or chopsticks. Try to purchase produce which is not wrapped in plastic. Avoid using disposable plastic shopping bags.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most local villages don’t have environmentally sound trash management systems.  Pack your garbage out to larger towns or cities when it can be disposed of appropriately.  If there is no toilet, dig a hole at least 25cm deep and bury human waste. Burn or bury toilet paper.
			</p>
			<h3>Respect Everything in Tibet </h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> intrude on local people&rsquo;s homes, tents, land or private activities (such as sky burials). Show respect for local&rsquo;s private property and personal space. Always ask for permission before entering private property or land.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> be disrespectful at religious sites or family homes by wearing shorts or revealing clothing or kissing or touching intimately in public. Remove your hat and shoes unless instructed otherwise and don&rsquo;t step over people or people&rsquo;s legs &ndash; feet are considered dirty. Don&rsquo;t relax by putting your feet up on tables or chairs.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> swim in holy lakes, sit on holy objects such as mani stones or walk on or step over prayer flags.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Avoid </strong>perceived political discussions or activities. You may get yourself or others in trouble.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong> break local laws and regulations: Remember that you are a guest in Tibet. Make sure you have the correct travel permits &ndash; your travel agency and tour guide or host could be fined or may even lose their license if you break the law.
				</li>
