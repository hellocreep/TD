				Dear Bruce,
				<p>
					We returned home on Wednesday this week. I just wanted to write to thank you and all of the staff at China Odyssey Tours for your excellent tour service. We are already recommending to friends that they should visit your website and arrange for tours if they are going to China. Your organization really provided what you promised. Not every company can say the same.
					With the exception of the Beijing-Shanghai flight, everything proceeded smoothly.
				</p>
				<p>
					We felt very well cared for by each tour guide, and we were impressed with the quality of the vehicles and hotels that were used.
					We might suggest a nicer 5-star hotel in Beijing, however, as the Crown Plaza was old and not as well appointed as our other hotels. The Harbour Grand in Hong Kong was wonderful. We might also suggest that guides be prepared to give different types of information to groups with children, as it was uncomfortable in Beijing to hear talk of concubines. This is not particularly good information for children. Simply a suggestion.
					We especially loved our time in Guilin, partly because Tony was a most outstanding guide and partly because of our excellent itinerary and experiences. Our friends living in Shanghai will probably be contacting you for a short tour of Guilin for October. Do please inform Tony that our time with him was our most favorite. But there are things we loved about each city we visited, and we felt that each guide was well-prepared.
					In any event, I just wanted to thank you for making our tour of China safe, memorable, and efficient.
				</p>
				<p>
					We wish you all the best in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sincerely,
					<br>
					Susan Sims and family
					<br>
